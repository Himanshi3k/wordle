# Project: Wordle Game

## Description

Welcome to the Wordle game, a text-based word-guessing game implemented in Java. Players can enjoy the classic Wordle experience with the added functionality of saving details and earned points. The game has been recreated to provide an engaging and interactive environment for users.

### Rules

- **Guess a 5-Letter Word in Six Attempts:** Players have six attempts to correctly guess the secret 5-letter word.

- **Feedback Display:**
  - If characters of the guessed word are present in the secret word but not at the correct position, '*' is displayed.
  - If a character is at the right position, '$' is displayed.
  - If a character is not present at all, 'X' is displayed.


The Wordle game has been recreated in Java, offering players the classic guessing experience with the following features:
Users can save their details, including usernames, and accumulate points based on successful guesses.


### Future Scope

1. **Graphical User Interface (GUI):**
   - Enhance the visual appeal of the game by adding a graphical user interface.
   - Integrate a user-friendly design to improve the overall gaming experience.

2. **Word Bank Expansion:**
   - Implement a system to extract words from a text file to expand the word bank.
   - This will diversify the game, offering players a broader range of words to guess.
   - Replace the current array-based storage for secret words with dynamic retrieval from a text file.

3. **Completed Leaderboard and Best Score Display:**
   - Once implemented, the leaderboard and best score display will provide users with a competitive and rewarding gaming experience.
